# EatStuff
<Hackathon project from BattleHack 2015 made by Leaf Cherngchaosil, Ryan Kim, Jake Schmitz, Chris Dellomes.> 

This project was made by Leaf Cherngchaosil, Ryan Kim, Jake Schmitz, and Chris Dellomes during BattleHack 2015 Hackathon event. 
Jake Schmitz and Chris Dellomes worked on making a server and Leaf Cherngchaosil and Ryan Kim worked on making IOS app. 
The concept of this app is to make waiting process and checking out process very easy at restaurants.

Instructions to use: 1. Scan QR code which is at a restaurant with EatStuff app. 
2. Scanned information leads the user to the next page to input name, email, and number of party. 
3. (We planned to put default waiting time in the app, but ran out of time. This will be implemented in the future) 
4. The payment can be done with one touch via Paypal in the app. 
5. The receipt will be sent to the user after the payment is done by SendGrid. 
6. (Paying tip function has yet been implemented, but it will be done in the future)

This is just a prototype and a lot more features will be implemented by teammates in the future. 
As I mentioned above, this app has in-built Paypal and SendGrid functions.

**The current app on GitHub will not work due to absence of server we made. 
However, it is possible to check out the structure of the app.
